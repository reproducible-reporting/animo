// The controller: the position of the deck, the clock that moves it, and the events that say
// it moved. Every piece of state the runtime keeps between two inputs is a variable of this
// file, and no other file writes one.
//
// It keeps one position, `<slide>.<state>`, and four things in step with it:
// which slide container is shown, the display state of that slide's tags, the URL
// fragment, and the `data-animo` attribute of the root element. The fragment is what
// makes a position addressable, which a deep link, a test and the reload of `typst watch`
// all need; the attribute is what lets a reader of the DOM see the position the runtime
// actually reached.
//
// A step animates, within a slide and across one slide boundary alike; everything else
// snaps. Restoring a position therefore snaps to it rather than animating into it, and so
// does any jump that is not between neighbouring slides.
// The fragment is written with `replaceState`, so stepping leaves no history behind.
//
// `show` is the only writer of the position. What happened is announced as events on the
// root element, once the DOM, the fragment and the clock have been written, so a listener
// finds the page in the state the event describes:
//
// - `animo:leave` with `{slide}`, when a position on another slide is shown.
// - `animo:enter` with `{slide}`, after `animo:leave`, when the slide a position is on was
//   not the one before it. The first position of the page enters its slide and leaves none.
// - `animo:position` with `{from, to, animated}`, last, with positions as `{slide, state}`.
//   `from` is `null` for the first position of the page. `animated` says that the position
//   was reached by a step and that the deck lets motion run, which is false for a jump, for
//   a cut and for a reader who asked for less motion.
// - `animo:mode` with `{from, to}`, when the input mode changes.
//
// The events bubble, so a listener on the root element, the document or the window hears them.
