// deck and on nothing that is on screen.
//
// The runtime is the files of `src/js`, joined in the order `deck.typ` names into the one
// script of the page, so they share one module scope and none of them imports another.
// A function declaration is hoisted and may be called from any file at any time.
// A top level `const` is initialised when its own file is reached, so a value is only
// usable while the script loads by a file that comes after the one that defines it.
// Only `boot.js` calls into the other files while the script loads, and `input.js` registers
// its listeners then.
