// The stacks of a slide: renderings that typst placed at one point, of which the runtime
// shows one at a time.
//
// `stack.typ` labels every rendering of a stack `animo-<kind>-<index>`, and the renderings of
// one stack are the labelled children of one group. The kind says what the index counts and
// how the rendering to show is chosen, which `stackKinds` holds. Nothing about a stack
// travels in the plan, so a stack is found by its labels alone.

/**
 * How the rendering of a state is chosen, per kind of stack.
 *
 * `select(effects, slide, stack, step, prepared)` plans one stack of a slide for the state the
 * step is entering, as `planState` describes the step: `index` is that state, `from` the epoch
 * the slide was showing, `options` how the step moves and `mirror` how long it lasts when it
 * runs backwards.
 *
 * A kind may also have `read(stack)`, which adds what it needs to a stack once, when the slide
 * is read, and `prepare(effects, slide, step)`, which plans what one step needs once per slide
 * before any stack of the kind is planned, and whose result every `select` of the step is
 * handed as `prepared`.
 *
 * An `epoch` stack holds one rendering of a region per content state, and a boundary between
 * two of them is crossed by the transitions of `boundaries.js`.
 * A `subslide` stack holds one rendering of a `per-subslide` per state, and snaps.
