// How an element is put into a display state: the timing a step takes from the stylesheet and
// from its operations, and the two phases that plan the effects of a step and apply them.
//
// Motion is driven by the Web Animations API rather than by CSS transitions.
// Each step writes the state's display state as inline style on the tag's inner group and
// animates from what the element was showing to that, so the style is the state and the
// animation is only how it got there: a step interrupted halfway continues from where it
// is, stepping backwards lands on exactly the geometry the earlier state had, and a
// deep link needs no transition to suppress.
//
// When a step starts an animation it never says when it began.
// Every animation of one step is created in one task, so they are all pending until the
// same frame and all take that frame's time, which gives the step one clock by
// construction, and that clock is the one an epoch crossfade joins.
// `document.timeline.currentTime` is the time of the last frame the browser drew, and
// firefox 153 draws no frames at all while the page sits still, so on a deck being read
// rather than clicked through it lags by as long as the reader paused, and an animation
// told it began then is already over.
// See *Findings*.

/** The `id` of every animation the runtime creates, which is how it tells them from others. */
const ANIMATION_ID = "animo";

/**
 * Whether the runtime created an animation.

 * `property` is which duration is wanted: a primitive within a slide and a slide boundary
 * have one each, so a deck of hard cuts between slides keeps the motion inside them.
 *
 * The duration is a default, so a deck duration of zero is still a step that moves when an
 * operation states a duration of its own, and an effect snaps only when it ends up with no
 * time at all (see `scheduled`).
 * The one thing that snaps a whole step is `--animo-motion: none`, which the stylesheet's

/**
 * The options of one effect: the deck's own, held back and stretched by its operation's.
 *
 * A delay becomes the effect's delay and a duration the effect's duration, rather than a
 * timer of its own, which is what keeps the step's one clock: every animation of a step is
 * still created in one task and measured from the same instant.
 * A duration the operation does not state is the deck's own, `--animo-primitive-duration`,
 * so that a change of the deck's tempo reaches every operation that said nothing
 * and leaves the ones that did alone.
 *
 * Only a delay needs `fill: backwards`. The display state is written as inline style before
 * the animation is created, so an effect that does not hold its first keyframe while it
 * waits shows the state it is going to reach and then jumps back to where it started.
 *
 * A step that snaps stays snapped, delays and durations alike: `options` is `null` for a
 * reader who asked for less motion, a deep link and the first paint.
 * An effect with no time at all, no delay and a duration of zero, snaps as well, which is
 * what an operation that takes the deck's duration of zero and a hard cut both are.
 * A delay with a duration of zero holds the effect back and then jumps.
 *
 * `mirror` is how long the step lasts, and it turns the schedule around.
 * A backward step is the forward one played from the other end, so an operation that ran
 * from `delay` to `delay + duration` runs from `mirror - delay - duration` instead and
 * takes exactly as long.
 * The last thing to arrive is then the first to leave, so a backward step undoes a forward
 * one in time as well as in geometry. It is `null` for a step that plays forwards.
