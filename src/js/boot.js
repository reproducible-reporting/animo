/**
 * Copy every paint server and clip path of the document into an `<svg>` that is always laid
 * out, and put it first in the document.
 *
 * Typst names a gradient, a clip path, a tiling, a mask and a filter by a hash of its
 * content, so a slide that repeats one of them from an earlier slide defines the same id in
 * a second frame. A reference resolves to the first element of its id in the document,
 * which sits in the earliest slide that uses it, and that slide is `display: none` unless
 * it is one of the two being laid out. Neither engine resolves a reference into a subtree
 * that is not laid out, so the fill is dropped and the clip is not applied.
 * A glyph is referenced through `<use>`, which resolves through the same first match and
 * does draw, so text is not affected. See *Findings*.
 *
 * The holder is not `display: none` for the same reason, and it comes first in the document
 * so that it is the first match of every id. The originals stay in their slides, which keeps
 * a slide self contained. Equal ids mean equal content, so the first definition of an id
 * serves every slide that uses it.
