// How a step crosses a boundary, of an epoch inside a slide and of a slide inside the deck.
//
// A slide is one `html.frame` holding one rendering of its body, and every region whose
// content changes holds an epoch stack in its footprint.
// The stack holds one rendering of the region per content state, of which one is shown at a
// time. A step that stays inside an epoch touches
// only the display state of the renderings already shown. A step that crosses a boundary
// carries the stacks that hold what changed from the outgoing rendering to the incoming one,
// which is what `transitions` below does, and every other stack shows the rendering of the
// epoch being entered without animating, because its renderings are the same picture.
//
// A slide boundary is the same mechanism one container out, and it is the whole container
// that crosses, because two slides share nothing to hold still. Two slides are laid out
// while they cross and no more: laying every slide of a deck out for the whole session
// costs a long deck seconds of first paint, which is paid at every reload of the live
// preview. See *Findings*.

/**
 * How a step carries an epoch stack from the outgoing rendering to the incoming one.
 *
 * There is one entry per transition, and the plan names the one each stack takes.
 * The record of a stack that a boundary crosses has an optional `transition`, which is the
 * name of an entry here, and an optional `args`, which is handed to the transition as part
 * of the record. A stack with
 * no `transition` crossfades, so a plan that names none is the plan of a deck in which every
 * boundary crossfades.
 *
 * `planEpoch` has already planned the state at rest of every rendering of the stack when a
 * transition runs.
 * The rendering being entered is shown and opaque, and every other rendering is hidden and
 * transparent. A transition plans effects for the renderings it carries in place
 * of those, and an effect it plans replaces the one at rest for the same element and
 * property.
 *
 * Each transition is handed the effects of the step being planned, the slide, the stack, the
 * epoch a step leaves and the one it enters, the record of the stack, how the step moves and
 * how long it lasts when it is running backwards, and takes what it needs of that.
 * The crossfade below needs no `from`, while the morph reads the outgoing rendering's
 * geometry.
 * It runs in the phase that reads and writes nothing, so any geometry it reads is the
 * geometry of the page before the step.
 *
 * A transition plans the state it is arriving at and animates from what the element was
 * showing into it, exactly as a display state is planned, so an interrupted boundary
 * continues from where it is and stepping backwards undoes it.
 */
const transitions = {
  /**
   * Crossfade the renderings of the stack.
   *
   * The two halves add to one through the `plus-lighter` the stylesheet puts on the
   * renderings, and the container of the stack isolates, so the sum stays inside the stack
   * and the outgoing rendering paints nowhere outside the region.
   *
   * Every rendering that is showing any ink takes part, and not only the one the step is
   * leaving. A boundary crossed while an earlier one is still running finds two of them
   * painting the region, which is what a long `duration:` on a `replace` makes easy to reach
   * and what a `wait:` shorter than a step or a presenter clicking twice reaches as well.
   * Fading all of them out on the new boundary's clock keeps the sum at one.
   * The outgoing renderings leave under one easing while the incoming one arrives under its
   * complement, whatever they were showing when the boundary began. A rendering that is hidden has
   * nothing to hand over and stays hidden where it is.
   *
   * A delayed crossfade starts late and a long one takes long, and either holds the boundary
   * open.
   * An outgoing rendering stays visible for the whole of the delay and the whole of the
   * duration.

 * still.
 * A slide transition is given two containers and has nothing to hold still, since the two
 * slides share nothing. One
 * table would take the union of both and every entry would ignore half of it.
 *
 * A slide transition is a function of the boundary's owner, which is the slide with the
 * higher number, and of a progress `p` that is 0 where the owner is not there yet and 1 where it
 * is. `at(p, args)` gives the display state of the owner and of the other slide at one of
 * those two ends, and `planSlides` animates from what each container is showing into the
 * end a step is heading for. A forward step heads for 1 and a backward step for 0, so a
 * backward step is the forward one played from the other end and needs no direction of its
 * own. The owner comes later in the document, so it is in front in both directions.
 *
 * `blend` is the `mix-blend-mode` both containers take for the boundary, and the empty
 * string leaves the stylesheet's `plus-lighter`. Two slides that overlap while both are
 * opaque have to cover rather than add, because two opaque grounds of different colours sum
 * to a third colour. A crossfade is the one transition that wants them to add.
 *
 * A `direction` is the direction of travel on a forward step, which typst writes as `ltr`,
 * `rtl`, `ttb` or `btt`. Typst states every parameter, its defaults included, so the
 * runtime holds no defaults of its own.
