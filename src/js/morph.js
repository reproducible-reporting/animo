//
// A match is a pair of elements, one in each region, that show the same ink.
// The outgoing element is translated from its place to the place of the incoming one, and
// the incoming element from the place of the outgoing one to its place, so the two are at one
// position at every moment. The crossfade puts them at `1 - t` and `t`, and the
// `plus-lighter` on the renderings adds the two to one opaque element on the path, so the
// morph needs no additional opacity and clones nothing. See *Findings*.
// A resize is a match of two paths of one structure whose geometry differs, and both paths
// also animate their `d` and stroke width from the outgoing geometry to the incoming one, so
// the two have one geometry at every moment as well. A shape morph is a match of two paths of
// different structures, which `alignPaths` rewrites into one structure before they are
// animated in the same way.
//
// The translations and resizes are routes and never states. They are animations over a
// `translate`, a `d` and a `stroke-width` whose inline style stays unset, so a slide at rest
// carries none,
// and the geometry a later step reads is the geometry of the layout once they are over.
// Until then, `slide.morphed` holds every element a morph is still moving, which is what a
// later step needs to know to read the layout under them and to settle them.
