// What a container resolves from its own children.

// A grid, a table, a list, an enum and a terms list read their own children and keep the
// ones that are `cell` or `item` elements.
// Every other child becomes the body of a cell or an item with default settings.
// A tag site and a region are a `context` block, which is one of those other children, so
// the element the author wrote stops being the container's child
// (measured on typst 0.15.0; see *Findings*).
//
// `body` names the field that holds the child's own content, for a child whose settings are
// the whole of the loss.
// Such a child that sets nothing beside its body lays out the same either way and is left
// alone.
// `body: none` marks a child the container drops whatever it carries.
//
// `article` is the article the child's element function takes, for the diagnosis.
//
// `fill` marks a child whose container paints the fill, which is where the second way out
// of the refusal applies.
