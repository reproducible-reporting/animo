// Which region each site of a slide sits in, and which regions a boundary therefore crosses.
//
// Only layout knows which tags a region holds, because a region receives its body as opaque
// content, so this is not something the resolver can answer.
// Every tag site and every region reports itself where it is laid out, and the reports are
// read back with `query` after the slide.
//
// What a boundary crosses follows from those reports and from the epoch it starts:
// the outermost regions that hold the tags the boundary changes.
// The HTML target places an epoch stack in every outermost region and none in the regions
// inside one, so such a region crosses a boundary as a whole, with everything inside it.
// The reports serve the refusals that are made after the slide.
// The browser finds the stacks a boundary crosses by itself, from the names of the tags laid
// out in them, except for a tag that becomes no group: the plan names the region of such a
// tag, from the reports, because nothing in the output does.

// `key` is the region the site belongs to, and `parent` the one around the site,
// which differ for a region with a number and for a tag that is its own implicit region.
// `group` is the label that the site's own group carries in the output, and is `none` for a
// site that is not the region its key names.
// It is how a key becomes something the browser can address, because only the site that owns
// the key knows what it called itself.
