// Regions: areas of a slide whose interior may be laid out afresh in every epoch,
// inside a footprint that stays the same.
//
// A region's content may change between epochs while everything around it stays where it
// is, so a region reserves the largest extent its content takes on over the epochs the slide
// actually has, per axis, and lays each epoch out inside that.
// It measures every epoch once, which keeps the cost linear in epochs and independent of how
// many tags the region holds.
//
// The HTML target lays the body of a slide out once, so a region there is where the epochs
// of the slide differ: it places an epoch stack in its footprint, one rendering per epoch,
// and the browser shows one of them at a time.
// Only a region that sits in no other region does, because the renderings of a stack are laid
// out once per epoch already, and a region inside one lays out the epoch of its rendering.
// A page lays out the epoch of its own state, so a region on paper lays out that epoch alone.
//
// A region between paragraphs is shaped by `block-region` below, which receives one
// rendering per epoch, `none` for an epoch with nothing to lay out, and a function that
// builds the container, and which knows nothing about tags.
// An explicit region and a tag that is its own region therefore share one measurement.
// A tag is its own region when its content changes and no explicit region holds it.
// Such a tag on a line is an `inline-stack` of `stack.typ`, and `stack.typ` also measures the
// box a region reserves.
//
// `block-region` must be called in a context, because it measures.
