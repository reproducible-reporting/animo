// Footprints and stacks: the box a set of renderings share, and the renderings placed in it.
//
// A footprint is what lets content change while what is around it stays where it is.
// It is the largest extent the renderings take, per axis.
// Every rendering is measured once, which keeps the cost linear in renderings and
// independent of what they hold.
// A rendering of `none` lays nothing out and counts as nothing.
//
// A stack places its renderings at one point inside their footprint, and the runtime shows
// one of them at a time.
// Typst renders every alternative and the browser chooses which of them is shown.
// A stack in the HTML target places every rendering the browser chooses between.
// A paged output knows the state of its page, so a stack there places the one rendering of
// that state in a footprint of the same size, and all three outputs agree to the pixel.
// A page lays out the epoch of its state on its own, so an epoch stack exists only in the
// HTML target.
//
// Each rendering of a stack carries the label `animo-<kind>-<index>`, so that the runtime
// finds it and knows what selects it.
// The kind says what the index counts.
// An `epoch` stack holds one rendering of a region per content state of the slide, and a
// `subslide` stack holds one rendering of a `per-subslide` per state of the slide.
// The runtime reads the renderings of a stack from the children of one group, so the
// renderings of one stack are siblings and every stack has a container of its own.
// A rendering of `none` is not placed, exactly as a tag site whose content an epoch removed
// lays out nothing.
//
// An explicit region reserves its footprint with the measurements below as well.
// It places its epoch stack with `placed-blocks` in the HTML target, and on paper it lays the
// rendering of its epoch out in the footprint rather than placing it.
// Every function here must be called in a context, because it measures.

// `measure` reports a height and no baseline, so the descent is read off a line that holds
// the content beside a zero-width pole taller than it: such a line is as tall as the pole plus
// the content's descent.
//
// The content is measured inside a box, because a rendering carries the display state of
// its epoch and a `move` is block-level.
// A block-level body pushes the pole onto a line of its own, so the descent read beside it
// covers a whole line and the ascent turns negative.
